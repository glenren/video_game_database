# CPSC 304 201 2023W2 Project

## Project Description
The domain of our application would be product information regarding video games, as well as personal user data, such as product review, completion status, and ownership. This is modelled by the use of having a user account, in which video games can be added. Information about the video game is also stored, such as the main developers, publisher, and any DLC (downloadable content) it has. A user may add a review to the video game as well. As such, this program would be ideal for tracking what video games a person has played, wants to play, or is playing, all in one spot regardless of what platform that video game is on.
